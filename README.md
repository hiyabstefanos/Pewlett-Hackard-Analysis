To combine data from multiple csv files that shared various data columns

## Results: 

90,399 employees fit the criteria for retirement at Pewlett-Hackard.

## Summary: 

Approximately 90k roles will need to be filled as these employees are ready to retire. We are able to view through our analyses how many of our silver tsunami employees belong to which departments and their corresponding titles. This provides us with a good insight as to which departments Pewlett-Hackard will need to reach out to in order to prepare them for iminent recruitment. There are only 1.5k employees that are eligible for the mentorship program and this is likely going to be an issue when 90k of our older employees retire. It is recommended that these 1.5k employees start training their current coworkers so as to increase their likelihood of being eligible for the mentorship program in order to prepare for the iminent hiring of new employees. As shown above, an additional code we can run to gain further insight to our data allows us to view how many employees are eligible for mentorship by their titles.
